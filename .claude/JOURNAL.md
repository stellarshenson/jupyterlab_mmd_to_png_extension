# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - JupyterLab Extension Implementation**: Implemented complete self-contained JupyterLab extension for copying Mermaid diagrams as PNG images<br>
    **Result**: Created client-side solution using Mermaid.js for rendering and HTML5 Canvas for PNG conversion. Context menu item appears when cursor is in Mermaid code block. No external dependencies (mmdc, playwright) required. Updated INSTALLATION.md and README.md with comprehensive documentation of self-contained approach

2. **Task - Dual-Mode Viewer Support**: Redesigned extension to support both editor and markdown viewer modes for copying Mermaid diagrams<br>
    **Result**: Implemented context menu target tracking using global event listener. Modified isEnabled() and execute() to detect and handle two modes - editor mode (cursor in Mermaid block extracts source and renders) and viewer mode (right-click on rendered SVG converts directly). Added viewer-specific CSS selectors for context menu. Extension now works in markdown preview/rendered view, not just editor

3. **Task - IMG Data URI and Download Support**: Fixed tainted canvas security error and added PNG download capability<br>
    **Result**: Discovered JupyterLab renders Mermaid in viewer as IMG tags with SVG data URIs, not inline SVG. Modified viewer mode detection to handle IMG tags with data:image/svg+xml sources. Fixed tainted canvas error by converting SVG serialization from blob URLs to base64 data URIs (src/index.ts:111-114). Added downloadPng() helper function and complete download command (mermaid:download-as-png) with dual-mode support matching copy command. Context menu now offers both copy and download options for Mermaid diagrams

4. **Task - Direct IMG Rendering and 300 DPI Output**: Resolved cropping issues and implemented high-quality transparent PNG export<br>
    **Result**: Replaced complex SVG parsing approach with direct IMG element rendering to canvas (new imgToPng function at src/index.ts:200-246). Eliminated all dimension detection complexity by using IMG.naturalWidth/naturalHeight directly. Configured both imgToPng and svgToPng functions for 300 DPI output (scale factor 3.125, calculated as 300 DPI / 96 DPI screen resolution). Removed white background fill to enable transparent PNG output. Extension now produces complete, high-quality transparent PNGs at print resolution

5. **Task - Configurable DPI Settings**: Implemented JupyterLab settings system for user-configurable DPI<br>
    **Result**: Created settings schema (schema/plugin.json) with targetDPI property (default 600, range 72-1200). Registered schema in package.json jupyterlab.schemaDir. Added ISettingRegistry dependency to extension. Modified svgToPng and imgToPng functions to accept targetDPI parameter with dynamic scale calculation (targetDPI / 96). Updated plugin activation to async, loads settings on startup, listens for settings changes, and passes targetDPI to all conversion functions. Users can now configure export resolution through JupyterLab Settings UI under "Mermaid to PNG Extension"

6. **Task - Dynamic Filename and Quality Improvements**: Implemented context-aware filename generation and fixed rendering quality issues<br>
    **Result**: Created generateFilename() function (src/index.ts:268-286) that extracts source filename from widget, removes extension, and appends 8-character UUID. Downloads now named as "mermaid-<filename>-<uuid>.png". Increased DPI range from 1200 to 3000 for ultra high-resolution exports. Fixed fuzzy rendering by removing context.scale() calls and drawing directly to target canvas dimensions. Added imageSmoothingQuality: 'high' and explicit alpha channel to both svgToPng and imgToPng functions. Canvas now draws images at full scaled resolution instead of scaling context, eliminating interpolation artifacts

7. **Task - Deterministic Filenames**: Implemented content-based hashing for consistent diagram filenames<br>
    **Result**: Created simpleHash() function using bitwise operations for fast content hashing. Modified generateFilename() to accept SVG/Mermaid content and generate 8-character base36 hash. Updated all download calls to pass diagram content for hashing. Same diagram content now always produces same filename, enabling reliable file management and version control

8. **Task - DPI Calibration**: Recalibrated DPI conversion to match Adobe converter output<br>
    **Result**: Analyzed Adobe converter output (10,284 pixels) vs extension output (3,693 pixels) at 600 DPI. Calculated correct sourceDPI as 11.5 (vs previous 96) by working backwards from Adobe results. Updated both svgToPng and imgToPng to use sourceDPI = 11.5 with direct scale calculation (targetDPI / 11.5). Removed 3x scaling multiplier. Extension now produces output dimensions matching Adobe converter within 0.07% accuracy. Commented out debug logging for production use

9. **Task - Documentation and Release Preparation**: Updated README, CI/CD workflows, and version for release<br>
    **Result**: Added GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, and JupyterLab 4 badges to README. Updated README with concise description, current features (configurable DPI, transparent backgrounds, deterministic filenames), installation instructions, and usage guide. Adapted build.yml workflow from working reference (simplified test/build steps, added ignore_links). Changed default DPI from 600 to 300 and maximum from 3000 to 1200 (schema/plugin.json). Updated version to 0.9.43 in package.json with complete GitHub URLs. Added screenshot to README showing context menu functionality

10. **Task - Fix Integration Test**: Fixed failing integration test for activation console message<br>
    **Result**: Added missing console.log statement (src/index.ts:687) that integration test expects: "JupyterLab extension jupyterlab_mmd_to_png_extension is activated!". Test was checking for this exact message in browser console logs to verify successful extension activation. Extension now properly signals activation completion for automated testing

11. **Task - Remove Editor Context Menu**: Removed context menu items from editor view, keeping only in markdown viewer<br>
    **Result**: Removed all editor mode functionality (getMermaidSourceAtCursor, isInMermaidBlock, renderMermaidToSvg functions). Removed editor mode checks from isEnabled() and execute() functions for both copy and download commands. Cleaned up unused imports (FileEditor, mermaid) and dependencies (@jupyterlab/fileeditor, @jupyterlab/codeeditor, @jupyterlab/markdownviewer, mermaid package). Changed context menu selector from 'body' to '.jp-RenderedMarkdown' for both commands. Context menu items now only appear when right-clicking on rendered Mermaid diagrams in markdown viewer, completely absent from file editor context menu

12. **Task - Production Release Cleanup**: Prepared extension for 1.0.0 production release<br>
    **Result**: Commented out all debug logging throughout src/index.ts while preserving error logging and integration test activation message. Simplified context menu labels from "Copy Mermaid Diagram as PNG" to "Copy as PNG" and "Download Mermaid Diagram as PNG" to "Save as PNG" for cleaner UX. Updated version to 1.0.0 marking stable production release. Extension now has minimal console output and streamlined user interface

13. **Task - README Documentation Rewrite and 1.0.3 Release**: Rewrote README.md following modus primaris principles, fixed CI/CD link checker, and published updated documentation<br>
    **Result**: Restructured README with clear opening statement explaining core functionality and right-click workflow. Organized features into two focused sections - "Core capabilities" (copy to clipboard, save to file, configurable DPI 72-1200 with 300 default, transparent backgrounds, deterministic content-based filenames) and "Technical implementation" (client-side canvas API rendering, zero external dependencies, calibrated DPI conversion at ±0.07% accuracy matching Adobe converter, viewer-only context menu). Updated all documentation to reflect current menu labels ("Copy as PNG", "Save as PNG") and removed outdated editor mode references throughout. Streamlined Installation section with single pip command, rewrote Usage section with clear workflow explanation and filename pattern documentation (mermaid-<document-name>-<content-hash>.png), simplified Troubleshooting with status check commands, and condensed Contributing section focusing on essential development workflow. Maintained flowing narrative style throughout while adding specific technical details and eliminating unnecessary complexity. Fixed GitHub Actions CI/CD link checker failure by adding YouTube URL to ignore_links parameter (.github/workflows/build.yml:160) to prevent rate limiting errors (429 Too Many Requests). Published updated documentation to npm and PyPI as version 1.0.3
