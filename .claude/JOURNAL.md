# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - JupyterLab Extension Implementation**: Implemented complete self-contained JupyterLab extension for copying Mermaid diagrams as PNG images<br>
    **Result**: Created client-side solution using Mermaid.js for rendering and HTML5 Canvas for PNG conversion. Context menu item appears when cursor is in Mermaid code block. No external dependencies (mmdc, playwright) required. Updated INSTALLATION.md and README.md with comprehensive documentation of self-contained approach

2. **Task - Dual-Mode Viewer Support**: Redesigned extension to support both editor and markdown viewer modes for copying Mermaid diagrams<br>
    **Result**: Implemented context menu target tracking using global event listener. Modified isEnabled() and execute() to detect and handle two modes - editor mode (cursor in Mermaid block extracts source and renders) and viewer mode (right-click on rendered SVG converts directly). Added viewer-specific CSS selectors for context menu. Extension now works in markdown preview/rendered view, not just editor

3. **Task - IMG Data URI and Download Support**: Fixed tainted canvas security error and added PNG download capability<br>
    **Result**: Discovered JupyterLab renders Mermaid in viewer as IMG tags with SVG data URIs, not inline SVG. Modified viewer mode detection to handle IMG tags with data:image/svg+xml sources. Fixed tainted canvas error by converting SVG serialization from blob URLs to base64 data URIs (src/index.ts:111-114). Added downloadPng() helper function and complete download command (mermaid:download-as-png) with dual-mode support matching copy command. Context menu now offers both copy and download options for Mermaid diagrams

4. **Task - Direct IMG Rendering and 300 DPI Output**: Resolved cropping issues and implemented high-quality transparent PNG export<br>
    **Result**: Replaced complex SVG parsing approach with direct IMG element rendering to canvas (new imgToPng function at src/index.ts:200-246). Eliminated all dimension detection complexity by using IMG.naturalWidth/naturalHeight directly. Configured both imgToPng and svgToPng functions for 300 DPI output (scale factor 3.125, calculated as 300 DPI / 96 DPI screen resolution). Removed white background fill to enable transparent PNG output. Extension now produces complete, high-quality transparent PNGs at print resolution

5. **Task - Configurable DPI Settings**: Implemented JupyterLab settings system for user-configurable DPI<br>
    **Result**: Created settings schema (schema/plugin.json) with targetDPI property (default 600, range 72-1200). Registered schema in package.json jupyterlab.schemaDir. Added ISettingRegistry dependency to extension. Modified svgToPng and imgToPng functions to accept targetDPI parameter with dynamic scale calculation (targetDPI / 96). Updated plugin activation to async, loads settings on startup, listens for settings changes, and passes targetDPI to all conversion functions. Users can now configure export resolution through JupyterLab Settings UI under "Mermaid to PNG Extension"

6. **Task - Dynamic Filename and Quality Improvements**: Implemented context-aware filename generation and fixed rendering quality issues<br>
    **Result**: Created generateFilename() function (src/index.ts:268-286) that extracts source filename from widget, removes extension, and appends 8-character UUID. Downloads now named as "mermaid-<filename>-<uuid>.png". Increased DPI range from 1200 to 3000 for ultra high-resolution exports. Fixed fuzzy rendering by removing context.scale() calls and drawing directly to target canvas dimensions. Added imageSmoothingQuality: 'high' and explicit alpha channel to both svgToPng and imgToPng functions. Canvas now draws images at full scaled resolution instead of scaling context, eliminating interpolation artifacts
